# ECE5554-Final-Project
**Team members: Liujun Zhang, Yijie Zhou, Tanjia Jun**<br/><br/>
This repository contains the final project report of team 7 for ECE5554. In this project, we have used an open-source package named Deeplab to track a bat's flight trajectories in a video. With only 10% of the data being labelled, we are able to achieve less than 5 pixels of testing error. In this repository, we also include some sample training images extracted from the video and the prediction made by Deeplabcut after the training.
