# ECE5554-Final-Project
**Team members: Liujun Zhang, Yijie Zhou, Tanjia Jun**<br/><br/>
This repository contains the final project report of group 7 for ECE5554. In this project, we have used an open-source package named Deeplab to track a bat's flight trajectories in a video. With only 10% of the data being labelled, we are able to achieve less than 5 pixels of testing error. In this repository, we also include some sample training images extracted from the video and the prediction made by Deeplabcut after the training. The project is inspired by the work done here: http://www.mousemotorlab.org/deeplabcut
